# ndk

The Android NDK is a set of tools allowing you to embed C or C++ (“native code”) into your Android apps. The ability to use native code in Android apps can be particularly useful to developers who wish to do one or more of the following:

- Port their apps between platforms.
- Use existing libraries created by other developers (or provide their own libraries to others).
- Increase performance in certain cases, particularly computationally intensive ones like games.
